    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of this project is to develop an application for product configuration using the ASP system clinguin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Product configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of product configuration, as it name says, is to configure a product.\n",
    "In our running example we consider the configuration of a new bike.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to product configuration contains a description of the possible configurations of a product.\n",
    "This is done in two parts:\n",
    "1. The first part describes the possible components of a product and their attributes.\n",
    "For example, a bike must have a front wheel and a rear wheel of some size, and it may have a bag with some number of pockets.\n",
    "2. The second part describes some constraints over the components.\n",
    "For example, one constraint can be that the size of the wheels of a bike must be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input may also contain a selection of components of the product and some of their attributes.\n",
    "This selection may be complete or incomplete.\n",
    "For example, the input may contain a complete selection of the components of a bike,\n",
    "or just consist of a selection of wheels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of product configuration is to\n",
    "find a possible configuration of the product that is consistent with the given selection.\n",
    "If there is no such possible configuration,\n",
    "then the output should explain why there is no possible configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clinguin\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinguin is an extension of clingo to create interactive User Interfaces (UIs) using ASP.\n",
    "\n",
    "UIs are defined as sets of atoms, which are then rendered by a frontend, and \n",
    "provide continuous interaction with an ASP solver based on user-triggered events.\n",
