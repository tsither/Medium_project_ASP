The DSL is part of the COOM software that ships along a compiler for the\nDSL together with a runtime API for interactive product configuration.\n\n<a name=\"domain\"></a>\n\n## Building up the Product Domain\n\n<a name=\"product\"></a>\n\n### Starting a Product (product)\n\nThe product declares the root element of the product to be configured. Hence,\nthere should be exactly one product.\n\nExample for a fashion advisor outfit:\n\n    product {\n        Underwear\t\tunderwear\n        Clothing\t\tclothing\n        Shoes\t\t\tshoes\n        Jewelry\t\t\tjewelry\n        num.##/€\t\tprice\n    }\n\nNote: The product itself does not have a name or identifier. It is unique in a\nDSL context and can be referenced by ':root'.\n<a name=\"structure\"></a>\n\n### Components/Complex Features (structure)\n\nThe product can be made up of a hierarchical component structure. The building\nblocks of the product can be defined by ''structures''. A structure works\nsomehow similar to a class in object-oriented programming in a way that you can\ndeclare fields. A field is made up by its type and its name. It can optionally\nbe preceded by a cardinality. The COOM reasoning engine will create instances in\nthe right amount to fulfill the cardinality restriction (and all other\nconstraints).\n\nExample for a structure 'Clothing' in the context of the fashion advisor:\n\n    structure Clothing {\n        0..1\tHat\t\t\that\t\t// Hat is optional\n        1x\t\tShirt\t\tshirt\n        \t\tPants\t\tpants\n               \tnum.##/€\tprice\n    }\n\nThe identifier of the structure (here 'Clothing') must be unique within the\noverall product DSL context.\n\n<a name=\"field\"></a>\n\n#### Fields\n\nThe structure ''Clothing'' declares four features in the following way:\n\n1. Cardinality (optional): A minimum required and maximum allowed number of\n   instances for this field can be specified. The cardinality is optional and if\n   omitted the min and max cardinality both are 1.\n2. Type: The type of the field is defined. It can either be an existing\n   structure, an existing enumeration, 'num' for numerical, or 'text' for a\n   string variable.\n3. Name: The name of the field. It has to be unique within the local structure.\n\nNote: For numeric fields, the number of decimal digits can be specified using\n'#' and also a unit can be defined (e.g. '€', 'mm', 'Kg').\n\n<a name=\"hierarchy\"></a>\n\n#### Hierarchy\n\nStructures can be nested using other structures as field types. In this way, a\nhierarchical 'component-based' product can be modeled. It is necessary that the\nlinked structures form a **strict** hierarchy, that means it may not have any\ncycles. If it occurs by mistake, that the linked structures contain a cycle, the\nDSL compiler will demand to fix this, throwing a corresponding error message.\n\nBy default all fields, that have a structure for a type, contribute to the\nproduct hierarchy (and can destroy the product model if a cycle is build).\nHowever, for fields that should not add new components to the product hierarchy,\nthe keyword 'reference' can be put before the field declaration. The effect of\nthe 'reference' keyword for (structure-type) field are:\n\n1. Instances for this field will not automatically created by the COOM reasoning\n   engine. The product modeler needs to take care, to what instances the fields\n   will be linked to and where those come from (for instance create by the user\n   in the UI).\n2. The field will not be included within the cycle check of the product\n   hierarchy.\n\n<a name=\"enumeration\"></a>\n\n### Simple/Terminal Features (enumeration)\n\nEnumerations represent features with a finite domain of predefined choices. The\nenumeration 'Pants' is a very simple example for an enumeration in the context\nof the fashion advisor:\n\n    enumeration Pants { jeans ; shorts ; hot_pants ; suit }\n\nAt the end of the day, a field the has the type 'Pants' has to take exactly one\nof the enumerated values: 'jeans',  'shorts' , 'hot_pants' , or 'suit'. The\nnames of these values have to be unique within the context of this enumeration (\nonly).\n\nThe identifier of the enumeration (here 'Pants') must be unique within the\noverall product DSL context.\n\n<a name=\"attribute\"></a>\n\n#### Enumerations with attributes (attribute)\n\n    enumeration Hat {\n        // attributes of a hat\n        attribute Color\t\tcolor\n        attribute num/cm\tdiameter\n        attribute num.##/€\tprice\n\n\t    // actual hats:\n        baseball_cap\t= ( blue   25   15.00 )\n\t    stovepipe_hat\t= ( black  30  189.95 )\n    }\n\nAn enumeration may specify attributes, that all of its values have. The values\nof the attributes fixed for each enumeration value. That is, attribute value can\nnever be changed within the configuration process.\n(If the attribute values should be able to change, it is probably a good idea to\nuse a structure with fields instead of an enumeration with attributes.)\n\nThe above example defines, that each hat has a particular color, a particular\ndiameter, and a fixed price. When the enumeration values (in this case\nbaseball_cap and stovepipe_hat), the attribute values are assigned in round\nbrackets. Similar to a field in a structure, an attribute in an enumeration is\ndefined by a type and a name. Also the types, that can be used, are the same as\nwhen defining fields in structures.\n\n<a name=\"behavior\"></a>\n\n## Constraints, Defaults, and Calculations (behavior)\n\nThe constraint logics of the product can be specified by defining 'behavioral\nblocks'. Each block can define behaviors for one predefined structure. To do so,\na block is started by the keyword 'behavior' followed by the respective behavior\nname, which is 'Clothing' in the following case:\n\n    behavior Clothing {\n        combinations\t( pants\t    \t   \tshirt       \t)\n        //===========================================================\n        allow\t\t\t( jeans\t       \t      -*-          \t)\n        allow\t\t\t( shorts\t          polo\t\t\t)\n        allow\t\t\t( shorts, hot_pants\t  t_shirt\t\t)\n        allow\t\t\t( hot_pants\t          t_shirt \t\t)\n        allow\t\t\t( suit\t\t          polo\t        )\n        allow\t\t\t( suit\t\t          collar_shit   )\n    }\n\nThere can be arbitrary many behavioral blocks describing the behavior of the\nstructure 'Clothing', which are all valid & active independently of each other.\nA behavioral block does (currently) not have a name or identifier but is\nanonymous.\n\n### Constraints via combination/variant tables (combinations)\n\n<a name=\"allow\"></a>\n\n#### Allowed Combinations (allow)\n\nThe above combinations table describes valid combinations of the fields 'pants'\nand 'shirt' in the context of an instance of the structure 'Clothing'. Any\ncombination, that does comply to some 'allow'-line in the table, is a valid\ncombination for the product (according to this behavior). Subsequently, any\ncombination, that does not comply to some line in the table, is invalid. A\ncombinations table can have arbitrary number of columns and the order of columns\nis also arbitrary.\n\nIn a cell, multiple values can be enumerated by using commas (','), resulting in\na one-of (logical OR) semantics. The star sign ('-*-') serves as a wild card,\nthat is any value matches.\n\n<a name=\"forbid\"></a>\n\n#### Forbidden Combinations (forbid)\n\nOpposed to the 'allow' keyword, there is also a 'forbid' keyword available, that\ncan be used to enumerate combinations that are forbidden:\n\n    behavior Clothing {\n        combinations\t( pants\t    \t    shirt          )\n        //===========================================================\n        forbid\t\t\t( suit\t       \t    t_shirt        )\n        forbid\t\t\t( shorts\t\t \tcollar_shit    )\n    }\n\n<a name=\"require\"></a>\n\n### Basic Constraints (require)\n\nWithin behavior blocks the keyword 'require' can be used to define constraints,\nthat is logical statements that need to be true to have a valid product\nconfiguration state.\n\nThe following behavior block example applies to the root structure of the\nproduct (as no structure is defined after the keyword 'behavior'):\n\n    behavior {\n\n\t    // a cylinder requires business shoes\n\t    condition clothing.hat = stovepipe_hat\n\t    require shoes = business\n\n\t    // conditional default: business shoes goes best with collar shirt\n\t    condition shoes = business\n\t    require clothing.shirt = collar_shirt || clothing.shirt = polo\n\n    }\n\nConstraints with require can be formed with or without conditions. Further, the\nconstraint after the 'require' keyword can be a complex boolean expression\ncomposed by logical operators.\n\n<a name=\"operators\"></a>\n\n#### Comparators and Logical Operators\n\nSimple feature expressions allow for the comparators equal ('=') and\nnot-equal ('!='). For numerical fields, also the numerical comparators lower\nthan ('<'), lower equal ('<='), larger than ('>') and larger equal ('>=') can be\nused to build simple expressions.  \nComplex logical expressions can be composed using the boolean operators AND ('\n&&'), OR ('||') and NOT ('!').\n\n<a name=\"default\"></a>\n\n### Defaults (default)\n\nThe use of defaults allows you to propose values to enum fields. These values\nwill be applied to the field if they do not contradict with constraints\naccording to the current state of the configuration and if the enum value has\nnot (yet) been set by the user.\n\nDefaults can be specified with or without condition as the following example\nshows:\n\n    behavior {\n\t    default country = Germany\n\n\t    // wearing flip-flops, you should prefer some cap\n\t    condition shoes = flip_flops\n\t    default clothing.hat = baseball_cap\n\n\t    // business shoes goes best with collar shirt\n\t    condition shoes = business\n\t    default clothing.shirt = collar_shirt\n\n    }\n\nNote: Defaults can be seen to make propositions to the user about product\nfeatures that are most likely desirable. However, as soon as the user manually\nselects a value to a feature, the default rules for that feature will not have\nany effect any more\n(until the user explicitly releases his/her manual choice).\n\n<a name=\"imply\"></a>\n\n### Calculations for Numerical Features  (imply)\n\nNumerical features can be calculated using the 'imply' keyword. The following\nexample calculates a value for the numerical feature 'price'. For the\ncalculation, the following operators can be used:\n\n    behavior {\n        define provision = 0.1\n\t    default country = Germany\n\n\t    imply price = (1 + provision) * (1 + country.tax * 0.010)\n\t\t\t\t\t* (clothing.price  + underwear.price + shoes.price + jewelry.price )\n    }\n\nOf course, only numerical features, attributes and constants can be used within\nthe formulas.\n\nThe following numerical operations are supported:\n\n| Operation        | Syntax          | Comment  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| addition      | +        |  |\n| subtraction     | -      |    |\n| multiplication | *      |     |\n| division        | /      |  be aware of downward rounding to integer   |\n| power        |   ^ |  |\n\n<a name=\"paths\"></a>\n\n### Paths Expressions\n\nConstraints, defaults and calculations are defined in the context of one\nparticular structure but at runtime, they are applied the component hierarchy of\nthe product. Therefore, it is often necessary to make statements across\ndifferent instances of the hierarchy, even across different levels of the\nhierarchy. For this purpose the COOM DSL provides the possibility to build path\nexpressions for referencing particular fields/attributes from any point of the\nproduct component hierarchy by using dots ('.') for path concatenation.\n\nFor instance, if we want to state, that the color of the hat needs to match the\ncolor of the shoes, we could use path expressions to write:\n\n      behavior {\n         require root.hat.color = root.shoes.color\n      }\n\nNote: 'root' always refers to the product root. Path expressions that are not\nstarting with ':root' are always resolved relatively to the structure, that the\ncurrent behavioral block is describing. To state that the earrings (field of\nJewelry) and wristband (also field of Jewelry) need to have the same color, we\ncan use relative path expressions.\n\n      structure Jewelry {\n         0..4 Earing earrings\n         0..1 Wristband wristband\n      }\n      \n      behavior Jewelry {\n         require earrings.color = wristband.color\n      }\n\n<a name=\"condition\"></a>\n\n### Conditions (condition)\n\nAll types of behaviors may have conditions that restrict the states when the\nconstraint applies. In the example below, the\nconstraint `require shoes = business` is only applied if the preceding condition\nis met:\n\n    behavior {\n         condition clothing.hat = stovepipe_hat\n         require shoes = business\n      }\n\nYou can add multiple conditions that all must been met, to make the succeeding\nbehavior apply. In the following example, the\nconstraint `require shoes = business` is only applied if both (!) preceding\nconditions are met:\n\n    behavior {\n         condition clothing.hat = stovepipe_hat\n         condition ocassion != party\n         require shoes = business\n      }\n\nEach condition only applies to the single behavior, directly following the\ncondition(s). So each behavior requires it's own conditions. If a condition (or\nmultiple conditions) should apply to a set of behaviors, you need to wrap a\nblock statement around them, als following:\n\n    behavior {\n         condition clothing.hat = stovepipe_hat\n         condition ocassion != party {\n            require shoes = business\n            require pants = suit\n         }\n      }\n\nThe behaviors inside a condition block can have additional conditions. The\ncondition blocks can also be nested.\n\n    behavior {\n         condition clothing.hat = stovepipe_hat {\n            // stovepipe hat always requires a suit\n            require pants = suit\n            // and usually also business shoes, but relax at a party\n            condition ocassion != party\n            require shoes = business\n         }\n      }\n\n<a name=\"macros\"></a>\n\n### Macros & Constants (define)\n\nWhen working with large product hierarchies, the use of path expressions becomes\nprevalent and also tedious at some point. To simplify the repeated use of (long)\npath expressions, the COOM DSL allows for macros using the `define` keyword. In\nthe following example, a local macro variable is defined simplify the repeated\nuse of the long path expression referring to color of the wristband.\n\n      behavior {\n         define wbColor = root.jewelry.wristband.color\n\n         condition ocassion = party\n         require wbColor = hat.color\n\n         condition ocassion = dinner\n         require wbColor = black\n      }\n\nNote that the variables declared by the `define` keyword are only\nvisible/available in the scope of the current behavior block. If you define a\nmacro inside a condition block, it is only visible/available inside that block.\n\n#### Constants and Formulas\n\nThe 'define' keyword can also be used to specify constants or formulas. In the \nfollowing example the constant PI is defined for being used in calculations:\n\n      structure Circle { num radius }\n\n      behavior Circle {\n         define PI = 3.1415\n         define PI_2 = PI * 2\n\n         imply area = radius^2 * PI\n         imply circumference = radius * PI_2\n      }\n\n<a name=\"instances\"></a>\n\n### Dealing with Instances\nHaving a product hierarchy nesting different structures with different features with arbitrary cardinality ranges raises the following challenge: \nHow many instances for structure features and how many values for num/enum features should the configured product have - given a particular range (e.g. 0..2 earrings)?\n\n#### Instances Created by the COOM Solver Automatically\nThe COOM solver will create an amount and combination of instances/values that satisfies all existing constraints (if that is possible).\nThere are cases, where different amounts if instances/values could satisfy all constraints. \nFor example, if it is required to have at least one earring of color red, \nthen this constraint can be satisfied by a solution with one earring but also by a solution with two earrings.\nIn general, the solver will aim to come up with a solution that minimizes the total number of created instances/values.\n\n#### Instances Created by the User\nOf course, for features with cardinality ranges the user can specify to have a particular amount of instances/values within that range defined as a user requirement.\nThese instances/values are given to the solver in a similar way as other user input values and the solver will try to find a solution incorporating these instances/values.\nEnabling the user to add instances/values for features with cardinality ranges dynamically on the UI is a non-trivial issue.\nIn particular, the UI level also needs to take care of the 'smart handling' of instance creation, \nthat is, the system should not allow the user to create instances\nif that will lead to an unsatisfiable state, but instead rather come up with a guided conflict resolution process.\nHowever, user interaction and conflict resolution will not be discussed with this DSL Quick Reference.\n\n#### Examples for Constraints over Instances\n\n**TODO:** instances examples\n\n<a name=\"ui\"></a>\n\n## UI Control\n\nIn an interactive product configuration session, the options shown in the user\ninterface usually need to change dynamically according to the configuration\nstate.  \nThe DSL provides some means to control the UI (if the employed UI is properly\nimplemented to listen to ui instructions of the runtime).\n\n<a name=\"hide\"></a>\n\n### hide\n\nUsing the keyword 'hide' allows to hide certain features from the UI. The\nfollowing behavior aims to hide the field 'jewlery' if 'beach' is selected as an\noccasion.\n\n    behavior {\n        condition occasion = beach\n        hide jewlery\n    }\n\n<a name=\"readonly\"></a>\n\n### readonly\n\nUsing the keyword 'readonly' allows to make the feature unmodifiable for the\nuser. Note: In smart configuration, conflicting values are automatically blocked\nfrom the users choice (without the need to use 'readonly'). In consequence, the\nuse of 'readonly' is usually necessary just in rare cases, for instance for\nnumerical calculations that should be displayed to the user.\n\nThe following example shows the use of 'readonly' for showing the calculated\nweight of the configured product:\n\n      structure Door {\n         num width\n         num height\n         num weight\n      }\n\n      behavior Door {\n         define weightFactor = 0.123\n         imply weight = weightFactor * height * width + 5\n\n         // set weight to readonly as the user should only set width and height\n         readonly weight\n      }","metadata":{},"id":"e4e792ef-6403-49f8-9f93-88b61a88474e"}]}
